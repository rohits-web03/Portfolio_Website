        <h2>2.Arrival(2016)</h2>
        <img src="./Images/image2.jpg" alt="Arrival Movie Poster">
        <p>A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world.</p>
        <p>The story Arrival is based on — the award-winning novella Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang — was published in 1998, almost two decades ago, which indicates its central themes were brewing long before this year. Arrival is much more concerned with deep truths about language, imagination, and human relationships than any one political moment.
            Not only that, but Arrival is one of the best movies of the year, a moving, gripping film with startling twists and imagery. It deserves serious treatment as a work of art.</p>
        <h3>Response from academics</h3>
        <p>David Adger, a linguistics professor who teaches at Queen Mary University of London had a favorable view of the accuracy of the linguistics in Arrival, saying that "the portrayal of trying different hypotheses about the language, coming up with generalizations, and testing them out was spot on."  
            Similarly, Jessica Coon, a linguistics professor who teaches at McGill University and helped with the film's linguistics, stated that "what the film gets exactly right is both the interactive nature but also that you really have to start small." She noted that the creators had not invented a complete language.
            Linguistics professor Betty Birner, who teaches at Northern Illinois University, said that the film's use of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis went "beyond anything that is plausible". She also felt the film oversimplified the process of translating the aliens' language, skipping straight from Banks establishing the basic vocabulary of the language, to her being able to understand abstract concepts such as "weapon".</p>
        <h3>Accolades, awards and nominations</h3>
        <p> Arrival received numerous nominations and awards. At the 89th Academy Awards, it won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, and had received nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design and Best Sound Mixing. Additionally, at the 74th Golden Globes, Adams had received a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and composer Jóhann Jóhannsson had received a nomination for Best Original Score.</p>
